# Public Assets – Concept

## Goal

A **simple and scalable public asset repository**:

- Publicly shareable logos, photos, screenshots, social media images, and press photos  
- Organized by topic areas (companies, brands, projects, products, individuals)  
- Standardized folder structure for all topics  

---

## Design Principles

1. **Simple** – clear, repeated folder structure  
2. **Scalable** – add new topic folders easily  
3. **Consistent** – same subfolders for each topic: `logos/`, `photos/`, `screenshots/`, `social/`, `press/`  
4. **Public-friendly** – only publicly approved assets  

---

## Folder Logic

```
<topic>/
├── logos/
├── photos/
├── screenshots/
├── social/
├── press/
└── README.md
```

- Each top-level folder = a topic (company, brand, project, individual)  
- Subfolders = media types  

---

## Benefits

- Clear and easy-to-navigate repository  
- Easy to extend with new topics or media types  
- Public assets immediately ready for use or linking
