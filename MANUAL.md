# Public Assets – Manual

## Purpose
Centralized storage for all **publicly shareable media assets** so they are easy to find and reference.

---

## Principles

- Organize by topic (companies, brands, projects, products, individuals)  
- Each topic folder has the same subfolders:  
  `logos/`, `photos/`, `screenshots/`, `social/`, `press/`  
- Use clear and descriptive file names (`logo-light.png`, `profile-jane.png`, `screenshot-homepage.png`)  
- Only add **publicly approved assets**  

---

## Adding New Content

**Easy way** – Use the template:

1. Copy the `/template/` folder  
2. Rename it to your topic name  
3. Update the `README.md` inside  
4. Add your assets to the subfolders

**Manual way:**

1. Create a new top-level topic folder  
2. Create the standard subfolders  
3. Add assets to the correct subfolder  
4. Optional: version files (`logo-v1.png`, `logo-v2.png`)  
5. Optional: new folder for additional media types (`banners/`, etc.)
