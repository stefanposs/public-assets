## Structure

Each top-level folder represents a topic, e.g.:

```
/stefanposs
/franz-josefposs
/template
```

Within each topic folder, the following standard subfolders exist:

- `logos/`          → All logos (company, product, brand)  
- `photos/`         → Profile pictures, team photos, portraits  
- `screenshots/`    → Product images, website screenshots  
- `social/`         → Social media images, banners  
- `press/`          → Press photos, media kits  

---

## Usage

- All assets in the topic folders can be **publicly shared**.  
- For logos or images of third parties, only use approved versions.  
- Do not add sensitive or internal files here.
